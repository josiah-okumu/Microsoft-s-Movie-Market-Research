## Overview
This project analyzed the movie industry, establishing what types of films are currently doing best at the box office. This information will be useful for Microsoft to potentially get into the video content production. Using descriptive statistics and exploratory data analysis on data from various databases from the Box Office Mojo, the IMDB, the RT, the TMDB and lastly The Numbers. From these, i have identified some incites and solution areas within which I make recommendations. These are business partnerships, content selection and personnel/hiring.

## Business Problems

Microsoft Studios is considering creating a new movie studio to create and produce videos like other giant companies already doing. However, doing this posses lost of challenges that needs to be prepared for, otherwise roadblocks will be witnessed along the way. The first block could be a saturated marketplace that everyone confident going into. Moreover, the second major issue of concern is that of the myriads of production and industries that the company is currently in, content production as well as live streaming platforms are not amongst them. Therefore, it is this lack of the required experience and expertise that can result in major mistakes in the business venture. Lastly, the lack of the content production experience could also roll over into the lack of subject matter experts, like directors and writers, in the content production process.

## Data
The data that has been used in this analysis came from majorly four different sources which are mainly:[RT_movie_info](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/),[TMDB_moviez](https://www.themoviedb.org/),[TN_movie_budget](https://www.the-numbers.com/) and [Bon_movie_gross](https://www.imdb.com/). All these are analyzed amd their similarity established for making recommendations concerning the current state of Microsoft's quest to venture into the movie industry.

## Methods

The project made use of descriptive statistics to comb through the data, analyze it by establishing some of the best performing studios, director/writers and the runtime and their effects on the sales in the industry. This establishes the top performing movies in the industry and possible reasons why they could be the best performing also established.

## Results
### Studio
It evident that most of the movie authors and directors have liked BV as their studio for producing movies and hence the highest sales exhibited domestically. Therefore, apart from the title, directors and runtime, another factor that affects the sale of movies in the domestic industry that Microsoft should consider is the studio.Domestically, BV is the most preferred studio.

### Runtime 
It is evident that the shorter the movie plot, the higher the rating and vice-versa. this means that shorter moving will tend to sell more than longer movies. this can be due to the fact that shorter movies leaves the audience in suspense and hence the urge to continue, despite the movie ending abruptly. This can be a recommendation to Microsoft to avoid long movies in their quest for production is they are to sell in such an industry.

### Genre
Majority of the movies in this market are short as can be shown by the lower mean depicted by the medium lines in the graph. for such a production to be witnessed with very few movies with longer runtime, outliers, it shows that the market is saturated with short movies like comedies and action movies. Therefore, production of longer historical movies might not sell in such a market. This implies that Microsoft can look into the length of their productions as they get into the market in order to penetrate the industry and market as well.

## Conclusions and Recommendations

Based on the analysis carried out in different movies as outlined in the content, the following recommendations have been made:

* Getting into partnerships and benchmarking with other studies who have been in the industry long enough are have proved themselves worth in the content creation and production, a case example is BV studio that dominated sales of titles, not only in the domestic market but also in the foreign markets.

* It was also evident that most people in the movie industry like movies with short runtime and for Microsoft to penetrate into the market, it should try and produce comedies, dramas and documentaries, all of which are short runtime content, liked by the majority of the industry consumers.

* Based on the analysis, the best selling movies are also writer and director specific. renown directors and writers should also be used to market the movies that will be produced by Microsoft as these factors also affects sales, either domestically or internationally. Further, as the movie production goes up, as was evident in the findings, Microsoft should be ready with resources to help in the continued production process without any production hiccups once it ventures into the industry.

* Despite these recommendations, there could be other myriads of factors that influences the movie sales and the industry in general. This is due to the fact that the perceived correlation might not be caused by the factors at play but instead other hidden factors that are not identified. this means that these recommendations may not be the only ones, more can be done and established in order to make proper decisions while venturing into a particular market.
